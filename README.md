# The-Space-Between-Us-Prototype-Build
A digital prototype of a platforming game made for my "Concept Development" 2nd year module.

I created this as part of a team with 3 other students: Gareth Mason, Malachi Clegg and Lukas Sobolevas.
My personal contribution was adding music and sound effects, as well as working alongside the team to
design the level layout, mechanics and finally coding the game. For a full breakdown of all members 
contributions, the game menu has a credits section. The credits also reference sources of visual and 
audio assets, as much of this is not our own.

This is a digital prototype not a fully complete game, as there are still small bugs, as well as some 
unpolished visuals and menu features. However, a lot of polish has still been added to the game in order
to produce an appropriate game feel, and it is not far off how we envisioned its completed form.
