# The-Space-Between-Us-Prototype-Build
A digital prototype of a 2 player platforming game made during 2nd year alongside 3 other students: Gareth Mason, Malachi Clegg and Lukas Sobolevas.
My personal contribution was adding music and sound effects, as well as assistance with designing level layout, mechanics and providing bug fixes for code. The credits section inludes a a full breakdown of all members 
contributions and sources of visual and audio assets.

The distance between the players is central to the main mechanics, and is shown through visual and audio effects. If the players are close, they heal and reduces damage taken from chasing enemies:

Distance also affects the speed of certain obstacles in the world, meaning that coordination is required to naviagte:
